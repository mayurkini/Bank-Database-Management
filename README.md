Bank Database Management: SQL Queries for Customer Transaction Analysis and Management

Overview

This project is designed for database developers and administrators working in the banking sector, specifically focused on managing and analyzing customer transaction data. It provides a comprehensive set of SQL queries and database management techniques to extract valuable insights from customer transactions, facilitate transaction management, and ensure database integrity.

Key Features

Transaction Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to analyze customer transactions, including withdrawals, deposits, and other types of transactions, to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.
Region-wise Analysis: Perform region-wise analysis of customer transactions to understand transaction patterns and trends across different continents and regions of the world.
Data Integrity Management: Implement stored procedures, triggers, and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity, prevent data duplication, and maintain database consistency.
Custom Functions: Develop user-defined functions to perform specific calculations and operations on transaction data, such as adding a percentage to transaction amounts or calculating total transaction amounts for a given transaction type.
Reporting: Generate pivot tables and customized reports to visualize transaction data, summarize transaction volumes, and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for the bank's operations.

Project Scope

The project encompasses the following components:

Database Structure: Includes tables for continents, customers, and transactions, each with relevant attributes to store customer and transaction data.
SQL Queries: Provides a wide range of SQL queries to perform transaction analysis, region-wise analysis, data management, and reporting tasks.
Stored Procedures: Implements stored procedures to handle complex queries and operations, such as retrieving transaction details for specific dates or inserting records into the continents table.
User-defined Functions: Develops custom functions to perform calculations and data manipulation tasks, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of transaction analysis.
Triggers: Implements triggers to enforce data integrity rules, audit transaction data, and prevent unauthorized actions, ensuring database security and reliability.
Reporting and Visualization: Utilizes pivot tables and customized reports to visualize transaction data and extract actionable insights for decision-making purposes.
